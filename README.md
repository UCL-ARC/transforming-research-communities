# Transforming Research Communities

This theme focuses on how modern data and computational tools are helping to shape and transform research communities, incorporating the development of digital researcher capability and a socially just approach to ongoing development. This includes the way we are publishing, communicating results, or accessing compute resources. It also deals with wider societal questions such as what the EDI impact of certain technologies is and how modern open technologies can help reach out to underrepresented groups of society.
